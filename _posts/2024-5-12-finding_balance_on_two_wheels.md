오늘은 자전거 첫 타보는 날이었어요. 🚲 몇 번 넘어지긴 했지만, 다행히 큰 다치지 않았답니다. 😂 조금씩 감이 잡혀서, 이제 혼자서도 잘 탈 수 있을 것 같아요. 🤗 이렇게 새로운 일에 도전하는 것도 나름 재밌네요. 💪 #자전거 #도전 #뉴비 #자전거 #도전 #뉴비

Today was my first day ever trying to ride a bicycle. 🚲 I fell a few times, but thankfully, I didn't get hurt. 😂 Starting to get the hang of it, and I think I can ride on my own now. 🤗 Turns out, trying something new can be pretty fun. 💪 #Biking #Challenge #Newbie #Biking #Challenge #Newbie

### Midjourney Prompt

A beautiful young woman with long blonde hair, depicted in a semi-realistic South Korean webtoon style, falling to the ground with the bicycle tilted. She is on a stylish bicycle, wearing a casual outfit and a safety helmet. Her expression shows intense focus mixed with alarm as she loses balance. The scene captures her dramatic fall, set against the vibrant backdrop of the park, emphasizing the critical moment just before she hits the ground. --cref <https://s.mj.run/4dvasWzVz4s> --cw 80 --v 6.0 --style raw --s 250 --ar 1:1
