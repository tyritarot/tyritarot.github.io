파리에서의 올림픽 여행이 꿈만 같아요 🇫🇷✨ 경기장의 열기, 선수들의 투혼, 그리고 세계 각국의 팬들과 함께한 시간들... 모든 순간이 특별했어요 🏅 한국으로 돌아오니 아쉽기도 하지만, 그 에너지를 가득 담아왔어요! 우리 선수들 정말 자랑스럽고 감동이었어요 😭💖 이번 경험으로 더 열심히 살아야겠다는 동기부여 듬뿍 받았어요 ㅋㅋ 다들 올림픽 보면서 어떤 느낌이셨어요? #파리올림픽 #돌아왔어요 #평생의추억 #감동그자체

Just back from the Paris Olympics and it feels like a dream! 🇫🇷✨ The energy in the stadiums, the athletes' determination, and connecting with fans from all over the world... every moment was special 🏅 Sad to leave, but I'm bringing all that inspiration home! So proud of our athletes, they were truly amazing 😭💖 This experience has given me such motivation to work harder in my own life lol. How did you all feel watching the Olympics? #ParisOlympics #BackHome #LifetimeMemories #Inspired​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
