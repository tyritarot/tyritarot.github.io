우와~ 5.5K 이벤트에 참가해봤어요! 🌙🐱 달 위의 해변에서 여유를 즐기는 고양이를 상상해봤는데, 너무 몽환적이고 아름답지 않나요? 추상적이고 유려한 선, 미니멀한 고양이, 그리고 멀리 빛나는 지구까지... 꿈같은 분위기에 푹 빠졌어요 💫 #MJEvent #MidjourneyKorea #5.5K진입 #Event 여러분의 작품도 너무 보고 싶어요! 다들 어떤 멋진 고양이들을 그리셨을지 궁금해요 ㅎㅎ 함께 즐기는 이벤트 정말 좋은 것 같아요 🎨✨

Wow~ I joined the 5.5K event! 🌙🐱 Imagined a cat enjoying a beach on the moon, isn't it dreamy and beautiful? The abstract fluid lines, minimalist cat, and the glowing Earth in the distance... I'm totally lost in this dreamlike atmosphere 💫 #MJEvent #MidjourneyKorea #5.5KMilestone #Event Can't wait to see your creations too! I wonder what amazing cats you all have drawn ㅎㅎ It's so great to have an event where we can enjoy art together 🎨✨

### Midjourney Prompt

A more artistic and stylized image of a cat enjoying a tranquil beach on the moon. The scene should be abstract with fluid, dreamy lines and a more painterly approach. The cat, depicted in a minimalist and elegant style, lounges on a softly contoured moon surface. The Earth should be shown in the distance, glowing in a vibrant yet soft palette. The lunar sand has a wavy, almost liquid texture, with surreal elements like floating seashells and craters. Use a mix of ethereal colors like deep blues, purples, and silvers to create a mystical and calming atmosphere. The overall style should evoke the feeling of a dream or a fantasy, with an emphasis on the harmony between the cat and its serene, otherworldly environment. --v 6.1 --style raw --s 250 --sref 3088944718
