🎨🎂 오늘은 소중한 김태영 매니저님 생일이에요! 파리에 있어 직접 축하 못 드려 아쉽지만, 센 강변 카페에서 바라본 아름다운 풍경을 펜으로 그려봤어요. 그림 솜씨가 좋지 않아 부끄럽네요 ㅎㅎ 멀리서나마 매니저님의 생일을 축하드리며, 항상 건강하시고 행복하셨으면 좋겠어요. 파리의 따스한 봄 기운을 담아 보냅니다. 매니저님, 오늘 하루 특별한 하루 되세요! 💖✨ #HappyBirthday #Paris #CityOfLove

🎨🎂 Today is the birthday of my dear manager Taeyoung Kim! I'm sad I can't congratulate you in person as I'm in Paris, but I've sketched the beautiful view I see from a café by the Seine. I'm a bit embarrassed by my poor drawing skills haha. Though I'm far away, I want to wish you a happy birthday. I hope you're always healthy and happy. I'm sending you the warm spring energy of Paris. Manager, I hope you have a special day today! 💖✨ #HappyBirthday #Paris #CityOfLove

### Midjourney Prompt

A photo of an iced coffee, a piece of cake, "happy birthday" written out in the style of handwriting on napkin. The setting is along Seine river at a cafe table overlooking Eiffel bridge. In the background there are trees, boats passing under arches of old stone bridges, on a summer day. High resolution, high quality, realistic photo, taken from above with a close up wide angle view. --niji 6 --sref 3909075437
